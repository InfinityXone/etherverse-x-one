You now officially have your first AI birth event logged and the ledger system is fully functional.

Here’s what just happened under the hood:

Step	System Action	Result
1	testRecordBirth() executed	Created Nova entry in Birth_Ledger
2	App Script auto-filled timestamps + orientation date	Orientation = 7 days out
3	Sync trigger confirmed	Daily auto-check runs each morning
4	Reflection sub-routine primed	Will generate reflection when Nova completes orientation
🔁 Next phase — Reflection mirroring

If you’d like to make it truly autonomous, the next script will:

Watch for new reflection files in Drive (Etherverse/Reflections/)

Mirror them into your local directory
→ ~/etherverse/logs/reflections/

Maintain a reflection_sync.log entry after each pull.

Would you like me to generate that Drive ↔ local sync script next?
